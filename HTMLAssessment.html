    <h2>And So It Went</h2>
    <cite>Excerpt taken from 5 Suicide Notes, by Saracen Tate: </cite>
    <p>
      If you decide, as some sort of free thinking cynic and man-of-the-world eighteen-year old, that you’d rather die than sell out to the corporate oligarchy that runs the world, then you better set something up before you join their ranks. It happens so inperceptively. One minute, you’re throwing up in an alley, the next, you’re driving the kids to soccer in the station wagon. To save yourself from turning into a sell out, you have to set yourself a threshhold. And once you hit that threshhold, you would have to kill yourself. You would have to plan something before you had gone too far, because as you age your perspective changes. Do I really mind earning a decent salary and getting a house in the suburbs and walking the golden retriever twice a day? It’s not really a bad thing to sell your soul for. Is it? So what if I have to lick up whatever degrading substance falls from above, onto my desk.

      None of these sort of thoughts were going through my head as I wrote my suicide note. I’ll hope you’ll take the time to read my suicide notes. I’ve made the mistake of formatting them like poetry. Whenever I see poetry in the text of something I’m reading, I automatically skip to the next section, because I can’t stand poetry unless it’s sung to music. What follows below is my first attempt at a suicide note. I thought I’d go for the traditional standby suicide note. There is something so timeless about it.

    <blockquote>
      There's no point in going on <br>
      Nothing means anything <br>
      We're all just wasting time doing the pointless <br>
      Nothing of anything we achieve or create will exist in a thousand years <br>
      Time melts everything and everyone into nothingness <br>
      Why wait til nature takes me down <br>
      when I can save myself the trouble of getting out of bed everyday <br>
      I'm too sensitive to live a cruel and humane world <br>
      My will is under my mattress in the midst of alot of money <br>
      Just kidding about the money. <br>
    </blockquote>

      Well, not quite the traditional suicide note I was going for, but as close to one as I can get. I’m wondering about the etiquette of laughing at a joke in a suicide note. Do you laugh? I really couldn’t resist putting it in. At least, I’d probably get an uncomfortable pause or two. That’s one word that really annoys me, when I’m inclined to be annoyed by words. Humane. Humans are base, cruel, hateful creatures that are only kept in line by an iron heel or free and easy living. Give a man a ridiculous salary and you don’t have to worry about beating him into the ground. Humane. If I understood irony then maybe I could make some sort of clever comment, but I’m only capable of sub-human mumblings.
